# Hyperdimensional Computing Feasibility Plan

## 1. Objectives & Context

- **Primary Problem Statement:** Validate whether hyperdimensional computing (HDC) can improve risk assessment, recommendation, or anomaly detection workflows within the GACP platform.
- **Success Criteria:** Demonstrate measurable gains (accuracy, robustness, latency) over current heuristics or ML models on at least one high-impact use case.
- **Constraints:** Maintain compliance (PDPA, WHO-GACP), integrate with existing Node/Next.js stack, leverage available farmer/application datasets.

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Target use case   | **Resolved (2025-10-31):** Farm compliance risk scoring selected during kickoff. | Product/Domain |
| Data readiness    | Do we have labeled datasets and telemetry sufficient for experiments?            | Data Team      |
| KPI baselines     | What are current accuracy/latency numbers to beat?                               | Analytics      |
| Compliance checks | Additional approvals needed for new algorithms?                                  | Compliance     |

## 2. Capability Assessment

1. **Codebase Review:** Inventory data ingestion, analytics services, and AI assistants relevant to the shortlisted use case.
2. **Data Audit:** Profile datasets (size, quality, update cadence) and catalog required ETL work.
3. **Tooling Gap:** Verify support for rapid prototyping (Python notebooks, vector libraries) and deployment pipelines (CI/CD, model serving).
4. **Team Alignment:** Set cross-functional working group (AI/ML, product, operations) for continuous feedback.

## 3. Technology Evaluation

- **Literature & Benchmarks:**
  - Kanerva (2009) core HDC theory.
  - IBM Research case studies on sensor analytics with HDC.
  - Comparative studies vs. deep learning for streaming anomaly detection.
- **Fit Analysis Matrix:** Evaluate HDC, classical ML, hybrid approaches across criteria: accuracy, explainability, cost, scalability, integration effort.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** Identify data sparsity, lack of tooling maturity, need for explainability; map to mitigation strategies (e.g., hybrid pipeline, human-in-loop review).

## 4. Prototype Plan

1. **Use Case Selection:** Decide on one scenario (e.g., farm compliance risk scoring) with clear metrics.
2. **Experiment Design:**
   - Define dataset splits and evaluation protocol.
   - Implement baseline model (current approach) and HDC prototype.

- Track metrics: accuracy/recall, false-positive and false-negative rates, inference latency, resource usage.

3. **Infrastructure:** Spin up sandbox environment, leverage Python HDC libraries or custom NumPy implementation, integrate with existing MongoDB/Redis if needed.
4. **Documentation:** Log experiment setup, parameters, and results in shared repo (e.g., `docs/research/experiments/`).

## 5. Review & Decision

- **Stakeholder Demo:** Present findings, compare metrics, discuss trade-offs.
- **Adoption Criteria:** Approve progression if HDC meets or exceeds baseline and passes compliance/security review.
- **Fallback:** If not viable, capture learnings and recommend alternative tech (graph models, conventional ML) for the same use case.

## 6. Execution Roadmap (Post-PoC)

1. **Integration Blueprint:** Outline API/service changes, data pipelines, monitoring, and rollback plan.
2. **Quality Gates:** Code review, automated tests, model validation, observability dashboards, documentation updates.
3. **Roll-out Plan:** Pilot with limited users/regions, collect feedback, iterate before full-scale deployment.
4. **Knowledge Sharing:** Update runbooks, conduct training for inspectors/operators, and schedule periodic model reviews.
