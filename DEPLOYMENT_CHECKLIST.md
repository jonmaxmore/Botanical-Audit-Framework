## Critical Metrics to Track

### Security

- Zero hardcoded secrets in production code
- All secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
- OWASP Top 10 compliance: 10/10
- No critical vulnerabilities

### Performance

- API response time < 200ms (p95)
- Page load time < 2s
- Support 1000+ concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime

### Quality

- Test coverage > 80%
- Zero critical bugs
- All E2E tests passing
- All portals 100% functional

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items

1. **Hardcoded secrets exposure** ‚Üí Fixed in Week 1
2. **AWS deployment issues** ‚Üí Mitigated with staging testing
3. **Performance bottlenecks** ‚Üí Addressed with load testing
4. **Data loss** ‚Üí Prevented with automated backups

### Rollback Plan

- Keep previous version deployable
- Database migration rollback scripts
- Quick rollback procedure documented
- Communication plan for downtime

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (Launch Blockers)
