# E2E Test Suite Implementation Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive end-to-end test suite implemented for the GACP Botanical Audit Framework, covering complete workflows across all three portals with cross-portal integration testing.

## Test Files Created

### 1. Authentication Setup (`tests/e2e/auth.setup.ts`)
- Authenticates users for all three portals before tests run
- Creates reusable storage states for:
  - Farmer user (`farmer@test.com`)
  - DTAM officer (`dtam@test.com`)
  - Admin user (`admin@test.com`)
- Verifies successful login for each role

### 2. Complete Application Workflow (`tests/e2e/application-workflow.spec.ts`)
Comprehensive 8-step workflow test covering the entire application lifecycle:

#### Step 1: Farmer submits GACP application
- Navigate to applications page
- Fill farm information (name, size, crop type)
- Fill farmer details (name, ID, phone)
- Fill address information
- Submit application and capture ID

#### Step 2: Farmer completes payment
- Navigate to payment page
- Verify payment amount (฿500)
- Generate QR code
- Confirm payment
- Verify payment success

#### Step 3: DTAM reviews application
- Access review queue
- Search for submitted application
- Review documents and approve each
- Schedule field inspection
- Assign inspector
- Set inspection date

#### Step 4: Inspector completes field inspection
- Navigate to inspections page
- Open scheduled inspection
- Complete inspection checklist
- Add notes and upload photos
- Submit inspection report
- Recommend approval

#### Step 5: Admin approves and issues certificate
- Access applications review
- Filter for approved inspections
- Review inspection report
- Approve application
- System generates certificate
- Capture certificate number

#### Step 6: Farmer views certificate
- Navigate to certificates page
- Verify certificate appears
- View certificate details
- Download PDF

#### Step 7: Public certificate verification
- Access public verification portal (no auth)
- Enter certificate number
- Verify certificate validity
- Check certificate details display
- Verify QR code generation

#### Step 8: Admin monitors audit logs
- Navigate to audit logs
- Search by application ID
- Verify all activities logged:
  - Application creation
  - Payment completion
  - Application approval
  - Certificate issuance
- Filter by success status

#### Error Handling Tests
- **Incomplete documents**: Test rejection of application without required files
- **Invalid certificate**: Test verification of non-existent certificate
- **Duplicate prevention**: Test system prevents duplicate applications

### 3. Cross-Portal Integration (`tests/e2e/cross-portal-integration.spec.ts`)

#### Application Data Synchronization
- Farmer creates application
- Verify application appears in admin portal immediately
- Test data consistency across portals

#### Real-time Status Updates
- Admin updates application status
- Verify farmer sees updated status
- Test bi-directional data flow

#### Certificate Verification After Issuance
- Admin issues certificate
- Public portal can verify immediately
- Test certificate data propagation

#### Payment Integration
- QR code generation test
- Payment details verification
- Payment status synchronization between portals

#### Document Management
- Document upload workflow
- Cross-portal document visibility
- Review workflow integration

#### Notification System
- Cross-portal notification delivery
- Notification badge functionality
- Real-time notification updates

#### Search and Filter
- Global search across portals
- Advanced filtering capabilities
- Multi-criteria search results

#### Performance Tests
- Page load time measurements (< 5 seconds)
- Concurrent user simulation (5 users)
- Resource usage monitoring

## Configuration

### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)
```typescript
- Test directory: tests/e2e
- Timeout: 120 seconds per test
- Execution: Serial (for workflow tests)
- Retries: 2 on CI, 0 locally
- Workers: 1 (serial execution)
- Reporters: HTML, JSON, JUnit, List
- Base URL: http://localhost:3001 (Farmer Portal)
- Screenshots: Only on failure
- Videos: Retained on failure
- Trace: On first retry
```

### Browser Support
- **Primary**: Chromium (Desktop Chrome)
- **Optional**: Firefox, Safari (commented out)
- **Mobile**: Pixel 5, iPhone 13 (configured)

## Test Execution

### Commands Added to package.json
```bash
pnpm run test:e2e         # Run all E2E tests
pnpm run test:e2e:ui      # Run with UI mode (interactive)
pnpm run test:e2e:debug   # Run with debugger
pnpm run test:e2e:headed  # Run with visible browser
pnpm run test:e2e:report  # View HTML report
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
npx playwright install chromium

# Start all services
pnpm --filter farmer-portal dev &
pnpm --filter admin-portal dev &
pnpm --filter certificate-portal dev &

# Run tests
pnpm run test:e2e
```

## Test Coverage

✅ Complete application submission to certificate issuance
✅ Payment processing with QR code
✅ Document upload and review
✅ Field inspection completion
✅ Multi-level approvals (DTAM → Admin)
✅ Certificate generation and distribution
✅ Public certificate verification
✅ Audit logging and monitoring

### Integration Points Tested

## Test Data Management

### Dynamic Test Data
- Uses timestamps for unique identifiers
- Prevents test conflicts with existing data
- Format: `ฟาร์มทดสอบ E2E {timestamp}`

### Cleanup Strategy
- Each test is independent
- No test depends on previous test data
- Unique IDs prevent data pollution

## Reporting

### HTML Report
- Visual test results with screenshots
- Failure traces with step-by-step replay
- Performance metrics

### JSON Report
- Machine-readable test results
- Location: `test-results/e2e-results.json`
