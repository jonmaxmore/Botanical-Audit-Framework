## 🎯 Recommendations

⚠️ Start frontend/backend servers to run all tests

## 🔍 Next Steps

### If all tests passed:

1. ✅ Proceed to Performance Optimization (Week 4 Day 2-3)
2. 📊 Run Lighthouse audit
3. 📦 Check bundle sizes
4. 🖼️ Optimize images

### If tests were skipped:

1. 🚀 Start frontend server: `cd frontend-nextjs && npm run dev`
2. 🔧 Start backend server: `node app.js`
3. 🔄 Re-run this test suite: `node tests/system-test-week4.js`
4. ✅ Verify API integrations
