# GACP Platform - Deployment Readiness Plan

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Pre-Production Assessment  
**Target:** AWS Cloud Deployment (Linux)

---

## Executive Summary

The GACP Platform is **80-85% production-ready** with a solid architectural foundation. This document outlines the critical path to achieve **100% deployment readiness** for real-world use.

### Current State
- ✅ **Backend:** 16+ modular services, production-ready architecture
- ✅ **Farmer Portal:** 100% complete, 97.6% test pass rate
- ⚠️ **Admin Portal:** 40-60% complete
- ⚠️ **Certificate Portal:** 60% complete
- ❌ **Security:** 300+ hardcoded credentials (CRITICAL)
- ✅ **Documentation:** Comprehensive (3,923+ files)

### Critical Blockers
1. **Security vulnerabilities** - Hardcoded secrets across codebase
2. **Incomplete portals** - Admin and Certificate portals need completion
3. **Missing environment management** - No AWS Secrets Manager integration
4. **Insufficient testing** - E2E coverage gaps
