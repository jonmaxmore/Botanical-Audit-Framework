# GACP Platform

Enterprise-grade certification and smart farming platform for Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP) compliance in Thailand, with primary focus on **cannabis** and five additional medicinal plant species.

## Overview

The system delivers an end-to-end digital workflow for growers, inspectors, and regulatory authorities:

- **Farmers** submit GACP certification applications, manage farm operations, upload compliance documents, and monitor IoT sensor data in real-time.
- **Inspectors & Reviewers** conduct document verification, schedule field inspections (VDO + on-site), and validate GACP compliance criteria.
- **Approvers** make final certification decisions with complete audit trails and transparency.
- **Certificate Verifiers** validate certificate authenticity via QR code and public verification endpoints.
- **AI-Powered Services** provide crop-specific recommendations for fertilizer, irrigation, and cultivation practices.

**Cannabis** is the platform's primary crop and appears first in all menus, forms, and analytics displays, with full support for five additional Thai medicinal plants: turmeric, ginger, black galingale, plai, and kratom.

## Core Capabilities

- **Certification Workflow** â€“ Complete GACP application lifecycle from submission to certificate issuance, with multi-stage approval (Document Review â†’ Field Inspection â†’ Final Approval), payment processing (30,000 THB total), and automated notifications.

- **Farm & Cultivation Management** â€“ Digital farm registry, field/plot tracking, cultivation cycle recording, harvest management, and comprehensive cannabis cultivation support.

- **Operations & Traceability** â€“ Seed-to-sale tracking, QR code generation for products and certificates, database-backed audit trails, public verification endpoints, and complete chain of custody.

- **IoT Smart Farming** â€“ Real-time sensor data ingestion (soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity), automated alerting for anomalies, and live dashboards for farm monitoring.

- **AI-Powered Recommendations** â€“ Intelligent fertilizer recommendations (NPK calculation, organic options), irrigation scheduling models, crop-specific guidance, and GACP-compliant practices.

- **Document Management** â€“ Secure file upload with magic byte validation, document categorization, version control, and S3-compatible storage.

- **Multi-Channel Notifications** â€“ Email, SMS, LINE Notify, and real-time Socket.IO updates for application status changes, inspection schedules, and certificate issuance.

- **Analytics & Reporting** â€“ Cannabis-first dashboards, regional breakdowns, approval rate trends, inspector performance metrics, and custom report generation (CSV, Excel, PDF).

- **Security & Compliance** â€“ Role-based access control (RBAC), separate JWT authentication for farmers and DTAM officers, rate limiting, OWASP Top 10 compliance (8/10), encryption at rest/in transit, comprehensive audit logging.

### Development Philosophy

**Before adding new features, always:**
1. Check `docs/EXISTING_MODULES_INVENTORY.md` to prevent duplicate development
2. Review existing code and determine if enhancement is preferable to new implementation
3. Refactor and harden current modules before introducing new components
4. Update documentation and maintain changelog
5. Ensure cannabis-first ordering in all UI elements

### File Management Guidelines

**When updating or replacing documentation:**
1. **Delete** old, redundant files that are no longer needed
2. **Archive** files that must be kept for reference â†’ move to `archive/` with timestamp
   - Example: `archive/README_2025-10-28_v1.md`
3. **Never keep** duplicate files with similar names in main directories
4. **Update** this README when major architectural changes occur
