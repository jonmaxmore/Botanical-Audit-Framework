## Guiding Principles

- **Scope Discipline:** Features outside these services are considered out-of-scope for the current finalization push.
- **Documentation:** Updates must be reflected in `docs/research/` (experiments) or `docs/governance/` once the documentation restructure is executed.
- **Python Utilities:** Existing Python scripts under `docs/research/scripts/` remain optional research tooling and are not part of the production surface area.
- **Progress Tracking:** Align sprint boards, OKRs, and release notes with this manifest to avoid scope drift.

## Immediate Actions

1. Map active tickets/OKRs to the service number in this manifest.
2. Audit documentation references to ensure only these services are highlighted.
3. Flag any code or docs that reference deprecated services for removal or archival.
