# Service Documentation

Each directory under `services/` corresponds to one of the eleven in-scope GACP services. Every service README follows the approved structure:

1. Overview
2. Capabilities
3. Components
4. Dependencies
5. SOPs & Runbooks
6. Migration Notes

## How to Use
- Populate sections with validated content migrated from legacy docs or new write-ups.
- Reference Jira/Linear tickets or meeting notes when summarizing decisions.
- Note any cross-service dependencies so platform teams can keep topology diagrams current.

## Templates
- `_TEMPLATE.md` â€” Copy this file when creating a new service page or refreshing structure.
