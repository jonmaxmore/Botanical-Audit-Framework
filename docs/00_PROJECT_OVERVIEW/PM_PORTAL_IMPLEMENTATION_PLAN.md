4. ✅ Trace Portal (Sprint 7-8)

**Rationale**: Important features, moderate complexity

### **Priority 3: Nice to Have**

5. ✅ Standards Portal (Sprint 9-10)
6. ✅ Farm Management Portal (Sprint 11-12)

**Rationale**: Enhancement features, can be delayed

### **Alternative: Integrated Approach**

Consider keeping some features in **Farmer Portal** instead of separate portals:

- Farm Management → Already in Farmer Portal
- Standards → Add as section in existing portals

**Benefits**:

- Faster time-to-market
- Easier maintenance
- Better user experience (single login)
