## 1. üéØ Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview

This 6-week enhancement project aims to **elevate the GACP Platform** across three strategic axes:

1. **Business Logic & UX Improvements** - Implement new business rules and enhance user understanding
2. **Advanced Admin Portal** - Build powerful tools for DTAM and Data Analysis teams
3. **Technical Excellence** - Strengthen infrastructure, security, and development processes

### 1.2 Why This Project?

Based on comprehensive stakeholder analysis from **SA, SE, MIS, UX/UI Designers, Frontend Developers, Data Analysts, and DTAM teams**, we identified critical gaps that, if addressed, will:

- ‚úÖ Improve revenue collection (fixed payment logic)
- ‚úÖ Reduce support burden (clear UX for policies)
- ‚úÖ Empower administrators (advanced analytics)
- ‚úÖ Ensure system stability (technical foundation)

### 1.3 Current State vs. Future State

| Aspect                 | Current State                                | Future State (After 6 Weeks)                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Payment Logic**      | ‚ùå Only charges ‡∏ø5,000 once at submission #3 | ‚úÖ Recurring ‡∏ø5,000 every 2 rejections (3, 5, 7...) |
| **Payment Timeout**    | ‚ùå No timeout, users can delay indefinitely  | ‚úÖ 15-minute countdown, auto-cancel if unpaid       |
| **Reschedule Policy**  | ‚ùå No limit, farmers reschedule repeatedly   | ‚úÖ Limited to 1 reschedule per application          |
| **Revocation Reapply** | ‚ùå Can reapply immediately after revocation  | ‚úÖ Must wait 30 days before new application         |
| **Refund Policy**      | ‚ùå Ambiguous, case-by-case decisions         | ‚úÖ Clear "No Refunds" with checkbox confirmation    |
| **Admin Analytics**    | ‚ùå Basic stats only                          | ‚úÖ Advanced charts, custom reports, export tools    |
| **System Performance** | ‚ö†Ô∏è No caching, slow queries                  | ‚úÖ Redis cache, DB indexing, <500ms API response    |
| **Test Coverage**      | ‚ùå Minimal or none                           | ‚úÖ >80% code coverage with automated tests          |

| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |

| **R-03** | **Technical Debt:** Discover old code issues that require refactoring, taking longer than estimated | Medium | Medium      | üü° **Medium** | Allocate 10-15% buffer time each week for technical debt. Prioritize critical refactoring only.                  | SA/SE              |
| **R-04** | **Resource Unavailability:** Key team member unavailable (sick leave, emergency)                    | High   | Low         | üü° **Medium** | Cross-training, pair programming. Document all decisions and code. Have backup team members identified.          | PM                 |
| **R-05** | **Integration Issues:** Components don't integrate smoothly with APIs                               | Medium | Medium      | üü° **Medium** | Early integration testing in Week 3. Use API mocking to unblock frontend. Daily stand-ups to identify blockers.  | SE + Frontend Lead |
| **R-06** | **UAT Failure:** DTAM team finds critical issues in Week 6                                          | High   | Low         | üü° **Medium** | Involve DTAM early (Week 3-4) for preview and feedback. Fix P0 bugs immediately.                                 | PM + QA            |

| **R-08** | **Security Vulnerabilities:** Security audit finds critical issues in Week 4                        | High   | Low         | üü° **Medium** | Security audit in Week 4 (early enough to fix). Follow OWASP Top 10 best practices from start.                   | SE                 |

### 7.2 Risk Response Plan

**For High-Severity Risks (R-01, R-02):**

- Weekly risk review in Friday sync meeting
- Escalate to Product Owner if mitigation fails
- Have contingency plans ready (reduce scope, extend timeline)

**For Medium-Severity Risks (R-03 to R-06):**

- Monitor closely in daily stand-ups
- Activate mitigation immediately if risk materializes

**For Low-Severity Risks (R-07, R-08):**

- Continue monitoring
- No immediate action unless probability increases
