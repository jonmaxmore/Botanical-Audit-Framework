# Execution Summary & Next Actions (Q4 FY2025)

## 1. Research & Benchmarking

- Launch Workstream A (Compliance Sources) per `RESEARCH_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
- Owners: Legal Liaison, Compliance Lead.
- Deliverables: populated `compliance-matrix.md`, source citations captured.
- Due: 2025-11-15.

## 2. Module Hardening

- Back-end leads review each module in `apps/backend/modules` against `module-inventory.md`; assign owners for every ‚ôªÔ∏è / üí§ item and log remediation tickets (naming convention: `COMPL-###`).
- Front-end leads ensure cannabis-first ordering across portals and replace mock datasets with live APIs; record findings in the same backlog.
- AI/IoT teams stabilise fertilizer engine logs and sensor ingestion; document model governance tasks under `COMPL-AI-###`.
- Use `cannabis-first-checklist.md` to capture evidence screenshots for each release.
- Track sprint-by-sprint objectives in `sprint-plan.md` and update during weekly compliance syncs.

## 3. Quality Gate

- Resolve outstanding lint/type/test failures (`pnpm run format:check`, `pnpm run lint:all`, `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm run test`).
- Integrate checks into CI pipeline; block merges until green.

## 4. Documentation & Governance

- Archive redundant manuals into `archive/` with timestamped names.
- Update `docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md` after benchmark research.
- Introduce quarterly compliance review meeting and change-log process.

## 5. Deployment Readiness

- Verify PM2/Docker scripts, health monitors, backup & incident runbooks.
- Prepare staging rollout using Atlas server configuration for acceptance testing.
- Confirm monitoring and alerting thresholds before production sign-off.
