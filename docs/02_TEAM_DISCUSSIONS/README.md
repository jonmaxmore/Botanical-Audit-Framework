## üìù Key Decisions

### 1. Architecture Approach: Monolith-first ‚úÖ

```
Decision: Start with modular monolith, migrate to microservices
Rationale: Faster MVP, lower complexity, easier debugging
Timeline: Monolith (Month 1-3) ‚Üí Hybrid (Month 4-6) ‚Üí Microservices (Month 7-12)
```

### 2. Database: MongoDB ‚úÖ

```
Decision: MongoDB as primary database
Rationale: Flexible schema, good for MVP, scalable
Alternative considered: PostgreSQL (rejected for MVP)
```

### 3. Frontend: Next.js 15 ‚úÖ

```
Decision: Next.js 15 for all portals
Rationale: SSR, API routes, React 18, TypeScript support
Alternative considered: Remix (rejected due to team expertise)
```

### 4. Real-time: SSE for MVP ‚úÖ

```
Decision: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
Rationale: Simple, sufficient for MVP
Future: Consider WebSocket for high-frequency updates
```

### 5. File Storage: S3 + Pre-signed URLs ‚úÖ

```
Decision: AWS S3 with pre-signed URLs
Rationale: Scalable, secure, cost-effective
Alternative: Local storage (rejected for production)
```
