#### Risk 2: Scope Creep

- **Mitigation**: Strict change control
- **Action**: All changes need PM approval

#### Risk 3: Backend API Delays

- **Mitigation**: Use mock APIs
- **Action**: Frontend can work independently

#### Risk 4: Security Issues

- **Mitigation**: Regular security audits
- **Action**: Code reviews by security expert
