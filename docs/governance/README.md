# Governance & Documentation Control

This area centralizes governance artifacts that document why items are archived, how changes are approved, and who signed off on scope decisions.

## Contents
- `archive-validation.md` — Pending and completed confirmations for archiving or removing materials.
- `documentation-log.md` — Time-stamped record of structural updates, approvals, and follow-up actions.
- Change-control templates and approval logs (to be migrated from legacy governance docs).

## Usage Guidelines
1. Log every request to archive, delete, or materially alter documentation.
2. Capture stakeholder acknowledgements before removing legacy content.
3. Keep references to supporting evidence (tickets, emails, meeting notes) so audits remain verifiable.
