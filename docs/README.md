# Botanical Audit Framework Documentation Hub

This directory is being reorganized to align every artifact with the eleven in-scope GACP services. Use this README to navigate the new structure while legacy documents remain in place for traceability.

## Navigation
- `services/` — Service-specific documentation following the approved template (overview, capabilities, components, dependencies, SOPs).
- `platform/` — Cross-cutting platform guidance covering infrastructure, data, security, operations, and tooling.
- `governance/` — Change control, archival validations, and compliance workflows.
- `SERVICE_MANIFEST.md` — Authoritative list of the eleven services and current delivery status.

## Transition Notes
- Legacy folders (e.g., `00_PROJECT_OVERVIEW`, `07_USER_GUIDES`) stay put until content is migrated and referenced here.
- Update `docs/research/DOCUMENTATION_LOG.md` with every structural change to preserve auditability.
- Use the governance archive tracker before deleting or moving any historical material.

## Next Actions
1. Populate the new skeleton with curated content from approved sources.
2. Replace existing links once migration is complete and validated.
3. Archive out-of-scope materials only after owner sign-off is logged in `governance/archive-validation.md`.
